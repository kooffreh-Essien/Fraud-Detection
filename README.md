# Introduction
This is a machine learning project to help detect fraudulent transactions in banks.

# Project Objective
The Objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that will be able to detect those transactions that are fraudulent, help save the bank from lossing money and also maintain a high reputation among its customers.

# Data Sourcing
The dataset used for this project was provided by the facilitator of the program.

# Data Transformation
ALot of transformation was not carried out as most of the variables were in their correct data type. The major transformation that was carried ut was grouping some columns to aid in visualization.

# Findings and Recommendations.
Based on the EDA carried out, we could see the type of transactions that were more likley to be fraudulent considring the time and amount it took foor the transaction to be processed. From the model build, we could see the best algorithm used to make predictions which was random forest and that would be deployed for production to help detect fraudulent transactions.
